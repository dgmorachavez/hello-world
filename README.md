# hello-world

In this place my first steps coding R and Python will be made. This is where the learning starts. 

As an economist, I will be working on projects that are related to my discipline, although more politically or sociologically oriented projects will also be found here from time to time. 

The first few entries will mostly have to do with introductory R exercises.
